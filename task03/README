GNU assembler and linker were used to assemble the x86-64 program.
Linux kernel aside, it has no dependencies.

It has been successfully assembled and later run using Linux 5.8.7 as follows:

as task3.s -o task3.o
ld task3.o -o task3

All functions conform to System V AMD64 calling conventions.

Program reads UTF-8 chars from stdin until EOF, defined as zero byte read. In other words, it handles input the same way cat does.
The program then prints how many times it has encountered each character of modern Russian and English alphabets while reading.
